::::::::::::::::::: HOW TO USE THIS?

Open the file named setup.json 
type your gituhb acount name replacing
"your_github_username"
select your languaje, either:
"en" for English or
"es" for Spanish


Please use project.json to add content to your project.

Find "project.json" at data/project.json

If the file project.json is empty, the script would 
take an example from the file named "demo.json" 
That's just as an example of how to add text, 
video, graphics or images to your project. 

I recommend to write the json file or convert from csv



::::::::::::::::::: NEED HELP?

If you run into trouble filling out stuff
I left an excel document called "help.xslx"
to serve as template. Find the file in the
"help" folder data/help/help.xslx
